  Testing <span class="label label-important">since 1.1.0</span>

%p
  Togglz has to be properly initialized before it can be used. In most application setups this is done 
  automatically. Unit tests are problematic in this regard, because they run in a minimal environment
  and  test code that may use Togglz to control behavior. Togglz therefore 
  provides extended support for managing feature state when running unit tests.

%p
  To add the Togglz testing support module, add the following dependency to your project. Please double check
  that you add it only for the <strong>test</strong> scope.

%pre(class="prettyprint lang-xml")
  :escaped
    <!-- Togglz testing support -->
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.togglz</groupId>
      <artifactId>togglz-testing</artifactId>
      <version>#{site.stableVersion}</version>
      <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency> 

%p
  Including this dependency will automatically configure Togglz in a way that is considered the best default
  behavior for unit tests. In this default setup every call to <code>isActive()</code> will return true, 
  which means that all features are automatically active.

%p
  If you need more control over your feature state, you should have a look at the extended JUnit support that
  is convered in the next section.

%h2
  JUnit 4 support
  
%p
  Togglz provides some extra goodies for JUnit users. If you are using JUnit, you should always
  include the JUnit support module in your test depdencies.
  
%pre(class="prettyprint lang-xml")
  :escaped
    <!-- Togglz testing support -->
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.togglz</groupId>
      <artifactId>togglz-junit</artifactId>
      <version>#{site.stableVersion}</version>
      <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>

%h3
  TogglzRule

%p
  The first important feature of the JUnit integration module is the <code>TogglzRule</code>. This rule
  allows to modify the feature state at runtime. This is especially useful if you want to
  test a special combination of feature states.
  

%pre(class="prettyprint lang-java")
  :escaped
    public class SomeJunitTest {
    
      @Rule
      public TogglzRule togglzRule = TogglzRule.allEnabled(MyFeatures.class);
    
      @Test
      public void testToggleFeature() {

        // all features are active by default  
        assertTrue(MyFeatures.FEATURE_ONE.isActive());

        // you can easily modify the feature state using the TogglzRule
        togglzRule.disable(MyFeatures.FEATURE_ONE);
        assertFalse(MyFeatures.FEATURE_ONE.isActive());
  
      }
    
    }

%p
  To use the rule, declare a public field for <code>TogglzRule</code> as shown above and annotate it with
  JUnit's <code>@Rule</code> annotation. <code>TogglzRule</code> provides static methods for creating a
  preconfigured feature state. In this example the rule initally enables all features of the <code>MyFeatures</code>
  enum.

%p
  The test first verifies that the feature is enabled. Then the method uses the <code>TogglzRule</code>
  to alter the feature state by calling <code>disable()</code> for the feature. The rule provides methods 
  for changing the state of individual features and bulk operations for enabling or disabling all feature 
  toggles at once.
  
%h3
  Feature variations

%p
  The JUnit integration module also allows to run tests with different combination of feature states. 
  This works very similar to JUnit's <code>@Parameterized</code> annotation.
  
%p
  Before explaining the details, see the following code:
   
%pre(class="prettyprint lang-java")
  :escaped
    @RunWith(FeatureVariations.class)
    public class FeatureVariationsTest {
    
        @Variations
        public static VariationSet<MyFeatures> getPermutations() {
          return VariationSetBuilder.create(MyFeatures.class)
                  .enable(MyFeatures.F1)
                  .vary(MyFeatures.F2)
                  .vary(MyFeatures.F3);
        }
    
        // will be executed 4 times
        @Test
        public void test() {
          assertTrue(MyFeatures.F1.isActive());
          assertTrue(MyFeatures.F2.isActive() || !MyFeatures.F2.isActive());
          assertTrue(MyFeatures.F3.isActive() || !MyFeatures.F3.isActive());
        }
    
    }

%p
  To run your tests in different feature combinations, your test class has to be annotated with 
  <code>@RunWith(FeatureVariations.class)</code>. This will tell JUnit to use a special JUnit runner 
  called <code>FeatureVariations</code> for executing the test.

%p
  In the next step you have to create a public static method returning a <code>VariationSet</code> and annotate
  it with <code>@Variations</code>. A <code>VariationSet</code> is used describe the feature combinations that 
  you want the test to get executed with. Typically you should use <code>VariationSetBuilder</code> to build
  the set, because it provides a fluent API for defining it. In the example shown above, the feature set will vary the features
  F2 and F3 and keep F1 enabled. This means your test methods will be executed four times, once for each of these
  combinations:

%ul
  %li
    %code
      F1=on, F2=off, F3=off
  %li 
    %code
      F1=on, F2=on, F3=off
  %li 
    %code
      F1=on, F2=off, F3=on
  %li 
    %code
      F1=on, F2=on, F3=on

%p
  This way of running unit tests is very effective if you want to verify, that the state of a feature has
  no effect on the output of your code.

%h2
  JUnit 5 support
  
%p
  Togglz also provides support for JUnit 5 aka JUnit Jupiter. Just add the following dependency in addition to the togglz-testing dependency
  
%pre(class="prettyprint lang-xml")
  :escaped
    <!-- Togglz testing support -->
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.togglz</groupId>
      <artifactId>togglz-junit5</artifactId>
      <version>#{site.stableVersion}</version>
      <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>

%p
  When using JUnit 5 there is no need for a JUnit Rule anymore. 
  

%pre(class="prettyprint lang-java")
  :escaped
    class AnnotationBasedTogglzExtensionTest {

      @Test
      @AllEnabled(MyFeatures.class)
      void allEnabled() {
          assertTrue(MyFeatures.ONE.isActive());
          assertTrue(MyFeatures.TWO.isActive());
          assertTrue(MyFeatures.THREE.isActive());
      }

      @Test
      @AllDisabled(MyFeatures.class)
      void allDisabled() {
          assertFalse(MyFeatures.ONE.isActive());
          assertFalse(MyFeatures.TWO.isActive());
          assertFalse(MyFeatures.THREE.isActive());
      }
    
    }

%p
  You can enable and disable all Features by using the <code>@AllEnabled</code> and <code>@AllDisabled</code> annotations.
  The first test enables and the second one disables all three Features of the MyFeatures enum class.
  In case you want to enable or disable specific Features you can add <code>org.togglz.testing.TestFeatureManager</code> as method parameter.

%pre(class="prettyprint lang-java")
  :escaped
    class AnnotationBasedTogglzExtensionTest {

      @Test
      @AllEnabled(MyFeatures.class)
      void testFeatureManagerParameter(TestFeatureManager featureManager) {
          assertTrue(MyFeatures.ONE.isActive());

          featureManager.disable(MyFeatures.ONE);
          assertFalse(MyFeatures.ONE.isActive());

          featureManager.enable(MyFeatures.ONE);
          assertTrue(MyFeatures.ONE.isActive());
      }
    }

%p
  Like in the examples before you have to annotate the test method with <code>@AllEnabled</code> or <code>@AllDisabled</code>. Depending on how many specific Features you want to disable or enable.
  In addition to that you can enable and disable specific Features by using the <code>TestFeatureManager</code> <code>enable()</code> and <code>disable()</code> methods like in the example above.

%h3
  Feature variations

%p
  The JUnit Jupiter integration module also allows to run tests with different combination of feature states.
  Variating Features in JUnit Jupiter is little a bit different to the JUnit 4 one. First you have to use the <code>TestTemplate</code> and <code>@VaryFeatures</code> annotations instead of 
  the <code>@Test</code> and <code>@AllEnabled</code> or <code>@AllDisabled</code> annotations. 
  After that you have to add a <code>VariationSetProvider</code> to your test class and as an argument to the <code>@VaryFeatures</code> annotation.
   
%pre(class="prettyprint lang-java")
  :escaped
    class FeatureVariationTogglzExtensionTest {

      @TestTemplate
      @VaryFeatures(TestingVariationSetProvider.class)
      void variations() {
          assertTrue(MyFeatures.ONE.isActive());
          assertFalse(MyFeatures.TWO.isActive());

          // active or not active, that is the question
          assertTrue(MyFeatures.THREE.isActive() || !MyFeatures.THREE.isActive());
      }

      private static class TestingVariationSetProvider implements VariationSetProvider {

          @Override
          public VariationSet<? extends Feature> buildVariationSet() {
              return create(MyFeatures.class).enable(MyFeatures.ONE).disable(MyFeatures.TWO).vary(MyFeatures.THREE);
          }
      }
}

%p
  The VariationSetProvider allows you to enable, disable and vary specific Features. In this example Feature ONE is enabled, Feature TWO disabled and the state of feature THREE varies every execution.
  This way of running unit tests is very effective if you want to verify, that the state of a feature has no effect on the output of your code.
